Challenge 20: Supervised Learning

In Challenge 20 we are trying to find which of our numbers (0 or 1) is a good loan or a high risk loan. We are given a data set that looks at which loans are good or not. 

Analysis Explained:
The analysis for this challenege is to create and then evaluate accuracy of the data model that predicts the loans of 0 and 1. This analysis will then help with whether people are worthy of a loan.

In this challenge we created a traning/testing sets to find predictions in the models.
Scores:
Bullet 1: in the Precision Score 0 is perfect at 100% and 1 is at 84%. That is a 26% percent difference. What this means is that there is a 100% accuracy found for 0 and is a great loan for people to borrow from

Bullet 2: In the Recall Score 0 is at 99% and 1 is at 94%. This a 5% difference. In the Recall score, this shows a 99% recall in the data that I found thus being overall great loan and high success.

Bullet 3: In the F1-Score 0 is at a perfect 100% and 1 is at 89%. this is a 11% difference. Again, from the data that I found this is a great accuracy at 100% and is great for loans that are for 0.

- Given what was found in the data, 0 (good loans) has a nearly perfect score for all the categories and has the most data to pull from. This is good information to have. The bad part about this is that (high-risk loans) is low and has the least amount of data to pull from. 

Summary of Real World Use:
From what I was able to find in my findings is that these findings are suitable for real world use. My recommendation would be to check and see if borrowers are worth of the credit. The reason for this is because as it is shown in the scores we have between a 99-100% accuracy outcome on the initial loan repayments. 

One thing I would recommend would be to have an equal amount of data for both 0 and 1 if not something closer. given what the data shows about the loans, 0 had way more data to chose from. This shows that it is a little unfair from what the data is and given to pull from.
