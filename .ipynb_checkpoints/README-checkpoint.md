Challenge 20: Supervised Learning

In Challenge 20: Supervised Learning we are trying to find which of our numbers (0 or 1) is a good loan or a high risk loan. We are given a data set that looks at which loans are good or not. 

In this challenge we created a traning/testing sets to find predictions in the models.

Scores:
Bullet 1: in the Precision Score 0 is perfect at 100% and 1 is at 84%. That is a 26% percent difference.
Bullet 2: In the Recall Score 0 is at 99% and 1 is at 94%. This a 5% difference.
Bullet 3: In the F1-Score 0 is at a perfect 100% and 1 is at 89%. this is a 11% difference.

Given what was found in the data, 0 (good loans) has a nearly perfect score and has the most data to pull from. This is good information to have. The bad part about this is that (high-risk loans) is low and has the least amount of data to pull from. 

One thing I would recommend would be to have an equal amount of data for both 0 and 1 if not something closer. given what the data shows about the loans, 0 had way more data to chose from. This shows that it is a little unfair from what the data is and given to pull from.
